# Nuxt, Buefy, & Netlify CMS Template

This is a template to speed up development for websites that are built on nuxt.js, with buefy components, and Netlify's cms as a backend.

## Design Choices

- Inter UI (https://rsms.me/inter/) is the typeface of choice.
- blueprint.css () for grid systems.
- Bulma (via Buefy) for other components for rapid prototyping.
