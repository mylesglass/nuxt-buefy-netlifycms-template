# Nuxt, Buefy, & Netlify CMS Template

This is a template to speed up development for websites that are built on nuxt.js, with buefy components, and Netlify's cms as a backend.

There are also a few default design choices that I have added in, mainly to do with typography.

TODO: detail how to adjust thee changes.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000

# build for production and launch server
